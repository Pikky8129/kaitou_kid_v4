Answer: 1. É¿-hydroxy-É¿-methyl-butyrate (HMB) - 3 Å~ 1 g/day
2. Deuterium oxide (D2O) - dosing over the first two weeks (0-2 wk) and last two weeks (4-6 wk)
3. Thigh lean mass (TLM) - 5.8% increase in HMB-FA group (5734 Å} 245 g p = 0.015) and 3.0% increase in PLA group (5644 Å} 323 g P = 0.06)  
4. DXA - measurement method for TLM
5. MPS - muscle protein synthesis
6. 1-RM - strength increase from 398 Å} 22N to 499 Å} 30N in HMB-FA group and from 396 Å} 29N to 510 Å} 43N in PLA group
7. MVC - maximal voluntary contraction increased from 179 Å} 12 Nm to 203 Å} 12 Nm in HMB-FA group and from 185 Å} 10 Nm to 217 Å} 11 Nm in PLA group
